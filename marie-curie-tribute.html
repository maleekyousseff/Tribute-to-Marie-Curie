        <img src="./R.jpg" alt="Portrait of Marie Curie">

        <p>Marie Skłodowska Curie was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the first person and only woman to win the Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win the Nobel Prize in two scientific fields.</p>

        <div class="quote">
            "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."
        </div>

        <p>What I admire most about Marie Curie is her unwavering dedication to science and her resilience in the face of adversity. Despite facing discrimination as a woman in the male-dominated field of science, she persevered and made groundbreaking discoveries that have had a lasting impact on our understanding of radioactivity and its applications in medicine.</p>

        <p>Her work ethic was legendary. She spent countless hours in her laboratory, often working in dangerous conditions with radioactive materials. Her commitment to her research was so intense that her notebooks from the 1890s are still radioactive and must be stored in lead-lined boxes.</p>

        <div class="achievements">
            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Discovered the elements polonium and radium</li>
                <li>Developed techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes</li>
                <li>Won Nobel Prizes in Physics (1903) and Chemistry (1911)</li>
                <li>Founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw</li>
                <li>Developed mobile X-ray units for use in World War I</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Marie Curie's legacy extends far beyond her scientific achievements. She broke barriers for women in science, paving the way for future generations of female scientists. Her dedication to using her discoveries for the betterment of humanity, particularly in the field of medicine, showcases the positive impact that scientific research can have on society.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, Marie Curie's brilliance, perseverance, and humanitarian spirit make her a true inspiration. Her life and work remind us of the power of curiosity, the importance of education, and the potential for scientific discovery to change the world.</p>
